	  The Direction Memory Access(DMA) is a high-speed data transfer
	  operation. It supports data read/write between peripherals and
	  memories without using the CPU.
	  Hisilicon DMA Controller(DMAC) directly transfers data between
	  a memory and a peripheral, between peripherals, or between memories.
	  This avoids the CPU intervention and reduces the interrupt handling
	  overhead of the CPU.
